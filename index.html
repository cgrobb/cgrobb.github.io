<h1>Robb Beal &#10022; Product Leader</h1>
<p>You've reached the product portfolio intro for Robb Beal, a Veteran, Apple Design Award-Winning Product Leader.
<p>Welcome, I've been expecting you!
<p>Below, I answer a variety of questions with the goal of helping you better understand me as a Product Leader. In many cases, the answers represent Case Studies of my work. This document supplements <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbbeal/" title="LinkedIn Profile Page for Robb Beal">my LinkedIn profile</a> and you'll find links back to LinkedIn for Case Studies that originated there.

<blockquote>
Importantly, you'll see a strong emphasis on Design/UX. That's because I highly value the contribution of Design/UX to product work. In fact, in 2017, where the experience is the product and companies are increasingly and correctly viewing their businesses as services, I don't think there's a meaningful difference between Product Management and Design, especially in the Definition/Discovery phase where I tend to concentrate.
</blockquote>

<p>Digital Product work is my life's professional passion. If nothing else, I hope I leave that impression with you. And, regardless of whether I'm a professional fit for you at this moment, if you share that professional passion, please connect with me on LinkedIn.

<h2>Tell Me About the Time Your Work Really Moved Important Business Metrics</h2>

<p>
<p>At Booksource in the Summer-Fall 2016, I lead the redesign of a Teacher- and Student-facing web app for managing the books in a Classroom Library. The app had seen slow-to-no growth over the past couple of years. In an incredibly short amount of time, I lead a brand new team through a product development cycle that put primary emphasis on improving the UX and secondary emphasis on adding new features.
<p><em>The results of that small investment was a 30% YOY improvement (sustained for 6+ months) in Monthly Active Users. Additionally, by bringing key product recommendation content out onto the app's home page, pageviews for the app's E-Commerce page increased 1000%.</em>
<h2>Talk to Me About Your Experience/Philosophy of Product Leadership</h2>
<img style="vertical-align: top;" width="50%" src="level4-designer.png"><img width="50%" src="level5-designer.png">
<p>
<p>Referring to the maturity scale in <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044949.do" title="Org Design for Design Orgs">Peter Merholz and Kristin Skinner's recent book</a> (see excerpts above), I'm transitioning from <strong>Level 4</strong> (Taking Charge) to <strong>Level 5</strong> (The Complete Product Leader).

<p>In terms of <strong>achievements</strong>, I've led teams in framing and solving hard problems (e.g. my complex fulfillment e-commerce work at F500 Graybar), and have driven multiple innovative efforts that uncovered new value with new kinds of experiences (e.g. my pioneering Social Software work with Spring at UserCreations).

<p>In terms of <strong>scope</strong>, for much of my recent career, I've owned the entire product experience (e.g., the end-to-end shopping experience at F500 Graybar).

<p>In terms of <strong>process</strong>, I establish a philosophy/mindset for how the team approaches its work using the <a title="Double Diamond Model of Product Development" href="http://www.peterme.com/2013/09/26/the-double-diamond-model-of-product-definition-and-design/">Double Diamond process for product development</a>. For my teams, introduction to the Double Diamond process is a vital part of all new team member onboarding.

<p>In terms of <strong>people</strong>, I've managed, hired, or lead 20+ product folks over my career. I set clear expectations for my team members, assist them in achieving those expectations, help them get unstuck, provide them frequent feedback both creative and professional, and generally establish a design team culture purpose-built to encourage the best work.
<p><blockquote>"Robb is a brilliant Product/UX Director and Strategist. I've had the great benefit of being managed and mentored by him across multiple companies throughout my career." &mdash;Elizabeth Woods, Product Designer</blockquote>

<p>In terms of <strong>cross-functional collaboration</strong>, there's a distinct split in the nature of the collaboration between the 2 diamonds: Definition/Discovery and Execution. In the earliest parts of Definition/Discovery, I'm often engaged in collaboration with Engineering/Data Science and Marketing/Growth peers to give just enough shape to a new product/service and to align business and product strategy so that it's meaningful/productive to engage our teams. In Execution, I'm assisting the team by defining/communicating clear goals, decision making, and roles and expectations.

<h2>Tell Me About the Design Scales You Work At</h2>
<img width="100%" src="https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/oddo_0303-a1c6200bb89124cf3f9f42c9b07b4f87.png" title="Conceptual Design Scales">
<p>
<p>When leading Design/Experience, referring to the scales in Org Design for Design Orgs (graphic above), my biggest contributions are at the Big Picture and Strategy scales.
<p>I call the work at these scales the "How It Works" part of design as a contrast to the "What It Looks Like" part of design.

<p>See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-works-digital-design-background-case-study-robb-beal">case study on How It Works Design</a> from my recent e-commerce work.

<h2>Show Me Some Innovative Product Thinking</h2>
<img src="1.2pr.jpg" title="Spring People Places Products Screen Shot">
<p>
<p>First, I was the Founder and Head of Design of a start-up that did pioneering (pre-Facebook) Social Software, called Spring.
<ul><li>It was Social Software and Social Objects (People, Places, Products, Etc) before these terms were coined.</li><li>It was minimalist, content-centric UI long before that trend even began.</li><li>It dealt with how to provide personalization and sharing while respecting privacy.</li><li>There was even a Social Object standard that would remind you of the (Facebook) Open Graph protocol.</li></ul>
<p><em>All of these thing were super-instinctual to me as I designed it.</em>
	<p>I was blessed that Spring was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/27/technology/turning-the-desktop-into-a-meeting-place.html">featured in the NY Times</a> and won an O'Reilly Media Award for Product Innovation, my 2nd major innovation award after winning an Apple Design Award for Innovation for my work on Watson at Karelia a year earlier.

<p>Second, you know how Conversational UX is all the rage these days? I was prototyping Conversational UX as early as 2000. Hereâ€™s the summary from my LinkedIn post describing the prototyping. Note how I adapted the design to better support the imagined business model.

<blockquote><img width="100%" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAh_AAAAJDQxM2Y4NzZmLTdhZjEtNDA0MC1iMzc0LTkyZTUwNTAwOTAwOA.png" title="Wireframe of a Conversational UX Prototype"><br><br><p>Circa 2000, I did personal prototyping of a verb-centric conversational UX that would serve as an alternative start page for web explorations. Imagine a UI in which a menu of common web actions like Buy, Sell, Trade, Rent/Lease, Subscribe, Reserve, Play, Join, Publish/Post, Contact (Email, Chat, Text, Call), Etc preceded the traditional Google search field and the choice in that menu informed all subsequent object auto-suggestions (and optionally inserted other forms of speech to make things feel more sentence-like).
The prototyping led me to the conclusion that, if the goal of a web start page (e.g., a search engine) is to ultimately get people to take actions on the sites it takes users to, actions/verbs should be higher-class UI citizens on those starting points.

<h2>Talk to Me About User Research</h2>
<p>In the vast majority of my product work, I've lead the creation of the user research plans to support a given product development project. A primary responsibility here is choosing appropriate types and sequence of research methods to use given the type of product being developed and the expected time constaints.

<p>A typical user research plan included 3 distinct rounds of research in ~1 months time. The 1st round typically would use Card Sorting, Reverse Card Sorting, and other attitudinal and qualitative research approaches to tease out what's important/valuable to users. Using the learnings from that 1st round, the 2nd round testing would often use Participatory Research approaches where we have users build hypothetical pages with semi-abstract content blocks. Wireframing based on that input would then serve as the design artifact for a final round of testing/feedback.

<p>Finally, having Directed UX for an analytics product (at LucidEra), I'm expert at the use of quantitative analytics to instrument and watch/visualize the real-world behavior of users interacting with production (or possibly prototype) user experiences. It's very common for me, for example, in Google Analytics, to create funnel visualizations of important site experiences like Checkout and Signup and then teach my team how to read and interpret those going forward.
<h2>Show Me Some Novel Interaction Design Work</h2>
<p>My experience over the years has shown me how powerful the concept of direct manipulation is to modern UI. When you <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/draft-seminal-moments-how-works-digital-design-robb-beal">look at many of the most important and innovative UI metaphors over the past 15 years</a>, you see that more than half of those involve direct manipulation UI metaphors (Google Maps, Tableau, Trello, Etc)
<p><img src="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0c6a01fbeb87acdf2f542b2dcece532a-p" title="Spring Drag Between Gesture">
<p>With Spring, I innovated heavily with direct manipulation gestures. One prime example is Spring's Drag Between gesture where you connect, for example, a person to a place with a line between them and display a menu of actions that apply to the two things being connected.
<p>
<p>Additionally, see below for 3 other examples of interaction design challenges I solved in designing Spring.
